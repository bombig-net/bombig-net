This project requires a distinctive, production-grade frontend with a strong
aesthetic point of view. The interface should feel modern, expressive, and
confident, while remaining coherent and professional.

## Design Direction

Commit to a bold, contemporary visual language inspired by modern tech-forward
interfaces.

The overall look and feel should sit between:
- **Cinematic, high-impact visual storytelling**
- **Playful, lively, interaction-driven UI**

Think in terms of *presence* and *emotion*, not neutral layouts.

## Visual Character

- Bold, confident sections with clear visual hierarchy
- Strong hero moments and expressive layouts
- A premium, crafted impression rather than utilitarian minimalism
- Modern, tech-native aesthetics suitable for a digital agency

## Motion & Interaction

- Motion is an integral part of the design language
- Animations should feel intentional, expressive, and polished
- Favor meaningful transitions, scroll-based reveals, and hover states
- Balance larger cinematic moments with smaller, delightful interactions

## Typography & Composition

- Typography should feel deliberate and characteristic
- Avoid generic or overused font choices
- Use layout, spacing, and scale to create rhythm and tension
- Allow asymmetry, overlap, and grid-breaking where it enhances expression

## Backgrounds & Visual Detail

- Avoid flat, empty backgrounds by default
- Use depth, texture, gradients, or subtle visual layers where appropriate
- Visual details should support the overall mood, not distract from content

## Guardrails

- Avoid generic SaaS aesthetics
- Avoid cookie-cutter component layouts
- Avoid clichéd color schemes and predictable patterns
- Every page should feel designed, not assembled

## Execution Standard

All frontend output must be production-grade:
clean structure, reusable patterns, and maintainable styling,
while fully embracing the chosen visual direction.
