# Product Definition

## Product Name
bombig-net

## Purpose

bombig-net is the primary digital presence of a modern digital agency.

The website serves three core purposes:
1. Attract qualified inbound leads
2. Convert visitors through focused, conversion-oriented landing pages
3. Establish trust through clear positioning, case studies, and social proof

This is not an experimental site or a short-lived campaign.
It is intended as a long-lived, production-grade system.

## Role in the Business

bombig-net functions as:
- the central marketing platform of the agency
- the first touchpoint for potential clients
- a credibility and positioning asset

The site must communicate competence, clarity, and confidence.
Every page contributes either to acquisition, conversion, or trust.

---

## Target Audience

The primary audience consists of:
- decision-makers evaluating digital agencies
- founders, product owners, and marketing leads
- clients looking for high-quality, design-driven digital work

The audience is design-aware, quality-sensitive, and comparison-driven.
The site must clearly differentiate the agency from generic competitors.

---

## Core Capabilities

The product provides the following capabilities at a conceptual level:
- Public marketing pages
- Conversion-focused landing pages
- Structured content such as case studies, services, and articles
- SEO-driven acquisition through high-quality content
- Clear calls to action and lead capture mechanisms

These capabilities define *what* the product does, not *how* it is implemented.

---

## Quality Bar

This product represents the agency itself.

The quality bar is therefore:
- high
- consistent
- intentional

Anything that feels rushed, generic, or unfinished is unacceptable.
The site must feel designed and deliberate at all times.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

bombig-net is explicitly **not**:
- a SaaS application
- a user-facing dashboard
- an authentication-driven product
- a backend-heavy system
- a playground for experiments

Features that move the product in these directions must be questioned explicitly.
