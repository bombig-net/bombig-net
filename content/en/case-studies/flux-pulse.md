## The challenge

Flux Pulse had strong technology but inconsistent storytelling across their funnel. The website had to communicate speed and trust instantly.

## The approach

We created a narrative spine, designed a clean, kinetic UI system, and built a fast Nuxt experience focused on conversion pathways.

## The result

The updated site lifted demo requests and gave the sales team a clear, high-impact visual narrative.
