## The role of motion

Micro-interactions and transitions do more than delight. They communicate precision, care, and momentum.

## Where to apply it

- Hero reveals that set the tone.
- Section transitions that guide the eye.
- Hover states that add tactile feedback.

## The rule

If motion does not clarify or elevate the message, strip it back.
