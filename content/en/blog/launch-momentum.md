## Why momentum matters

Every launch has a window of attention. The job of the marketing site is to make that window count by reducing confusion and amplifying trust.

## The essentials

- Give every section a single clear purpose.
- Keep the story aligned with the sales narrative.
- Prioritize fast loading, clear typography, and strong calls to action.

## The payoff

When the message is clear, conversion becomes less about persuasion and more about momentum.
