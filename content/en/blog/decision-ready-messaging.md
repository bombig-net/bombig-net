## Make the decision easy

Great messaging does not shout louder. It removes friction, answers the real objections, and sets a clear next step.

## Proof before persuasion

- Lead with outcomes, not features.
- Show the constraints you solved.
- Make the price of inaction visible.

## The test

If a first-time visitor can explain your value in one sentence, the message is doing its job.
